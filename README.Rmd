`rsimsum` is an R package that can compute summary statistics from simulation studies. `rsimsum` is modelled upon a similar package available in Stata, the user-written command `simsum` (White I.R., 2010).

The aim of `rsimsum` is to help to report simulation studies, including understanding the role of chance in results of simulation studies: Monte Carlo standard errors and confidence intervals based on them are computed and presented to the user by default. `rsimsum` can compute a wide variety of summary statistics: bias, empirical and model-based standard errors, relative precision, relative error in model standard error, mean squared error, coverage, bias. Further details on each summary statistic are presented elsewhere (White I.R., 2010; Morris _et al_, 2017).

The main function of `rsimsum` is called `simsum` and can handle simulation studies with a single estimand of interest at a time. Missing values are excluded by default, and it is possible to define boundary values to drop estimated values or standard errors exceeding such limits. It is possible to define a variable representing methods compared with the simulation study, and it is possible to define _by_ factors, that is, factors that vary between the different simulated scenarios (data-generating mechanisms, DGMs). However, methods and DGMs are not strictly required: in that case, a simulation study with a single scenario and a single method is assumed. Finally, `rsimsum` provides a function named `multisimsum` that allows summarising simulation studies with multiple estimands as well.

An important step of reporting a simulation study consists in visualising the results; therefore, `rsimsum` exploits the R package [`ggplot2`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggplot2) to produce a portfolio of opinionated data visualisations for quick exploration of results, inferring colours and facetting by data-generating mechanisms. `rsimsum` includes methods to produce (1) plots of summary statistics with confidence intervals based on Monte Carlo standard errors (forest plots, bar plots, and lolly plots), (2) zipper plots to graphically visualise coverage by directly plotting confidence intervals, and (3) heat plots. The latter is a visualisation type that has not been traditionally used to present results of simulation studies, and consists in a mosaic plot where the factor on the x-axis is the methods compared with the current simulation study and the factor on the y-axis is one of the data-generating factors, as selected by the user. Each tile of the mosaic plot is coloured according to the value of the summary statistic of interest, with a red colour representing values above the target value and a blue colour representing values below the target.

## Installation

You can install `rsimsum` from CRAN:

```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("rsimsum")
```

Alternatively, it is possible to install the development version from GitHub via:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ellessenne/rsimsum")
```

## Example

This is a basic example using data from a simulation study on missing data (type `help("MIsim", package = "rsimsum")` in the R console for more information):

```{r simsum}
library(rsimsum)
data("MIsim", package = "rsimsum")
s <- simsum(data = MIsim, estvarname = "b", true = 0.5, se = "se", methodvar = "method")
s
```

Summarising the results:

```{r summary}
summary(s)
```

## Vignettes

`rsimsum` comes with 4 vignettes. In particular, check out the introductory one:

```{r vignette-intro, eval = FALSE}
vignette(topic = "introduction", package = "rsimsum")
```

## Visualising results

As of version `0.2.0`, `rsimsum` can produce a variety of plots:

```{r pattern}
s <- simsum(data = MIsim, estvarname = "b", true = 0.5, se = "se", methodvar = "method", x = TRUE)
pattern(s)
```

```{r lolly}
lolly(s, sstat = "bias")
```

```{r zipper}
zipper(s)
```

As of version `0.3.0`, forest plots and bar plots are supported too as alternatives to lolly plots:

```{r forest}
forest(s, sstat = "bias")
```

```{r bar}
bar(s, sstat = "bias")
```

More info on the vignette dedicated to plotting:

```{r vignette-plotting, eval = FALSE}
vignette(topic = "plotting", package = "rsimsum")
```

# Warning for RStudio users

If you use RStudio and equations are not displayed properly within the RStudio viewer window, please access the vignette from [the CRAN website](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rsimsum/) or directly from the R console with the command:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
vignette(topic = "introduction", package = "rsimsum")
```

This is a known issue with RStudio (see [#2253](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues/2253)).
