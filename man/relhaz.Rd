\title{Example of a simulation study on survival modelling}
\format{A data frame with 3,000 rows and 4 variables:
\itemize{
\item \code{dataset} Simulated dataset number.
\item \code{n} Sample size of the simulate dataset.
\item \code{baseline} Baseline hazard function of the simulated dataset.
\item \code{model} Method used (\code{Cox}, \code{Exponential} or \code{Weibull}).
\item \code{theta} Point estimate for the log-hazard ratio.
\item \code{se} Standard error of the point estimate.

\description{
A dataset from a simulation study assessing the impact of misspecifying the baseline hazard in survival models on regression coefficients. One thousand datasets were simulated, each containing a binary treatment variable with a log-hazard ratio of -0.50. Survival data was simulated for two different sample sizes, 100 and 500 individuals, and under two different baseline hazard functions, exponential and Weibull. Consequently, a Cox model, an exponential model, and a Weibull model were fit to each simulated dataset.
