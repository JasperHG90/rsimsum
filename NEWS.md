Internal housekeeping.

# rsimsum 0.1.0

First submission to CRAN. `rsimsum` can handle:

* simulation studies with a single estimand
* simulation studies with multiple estimands
* simulation studies with multiple methods to compare
* simulation studies with multiple data-generating mechanisms (e.g. 'by' factors)

Summary statistics that can be computed are: bias, empirical standard error, mean squared error, percentage gain in precision relative to a reference method, model-based standard error, coverage, bias-corrected coverage, and power. 

Monte Carlo standard errors for each summary statistic can be computed as well.
