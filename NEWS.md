# rsimsum 0.1.0-9000

Internal housekeeping.

Added S3 methods for `simsum` and `multisimsum` objects to visualise results:
* `lolly()`, for lolly plots;
* `zip()`, for zip plots;
* `heat()`, for heat plots;
* `pattern()`, for scatter plots of estimates vs SEs.

Added a new vignette _Visualising results from rsimsum_ to introduce the abovementioned plots.

Added `x` argument to `simsum` and `multisimsum` to include original dataset as a slot of the returned object.

Added a `miss` function for obtaining basic information on missingness in simulation results. `miss` has methods `print` and `get_data`.

# rsimsum 0.1.0

First submission to CRAN. `rsimsum` can handle:

* simulation studies with a single estimand
* simulation studies with multiple estimands
* simulation studies with multiple methods to compare
* simulation studies with multiple data-generating mechanisms (e.g. 'by' factors)

Summary statistics that can be computed are: bias, empirical standard error, mean squared error, percentage gain in precision relative to a reference method, model-based standard error, coverage, bias-corrected coverage, and power. 

Monte Carlo standard errors for each summary statistic can be computed as well.
